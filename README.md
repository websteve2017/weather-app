# Weather App
Basic React Weather App


## TASK
Your goal in this task is to implement a simple front-end for a weather application.  
Implement a simple SPA to consume the [OpenWeatherMap api](http://openweathermap.org/) 
and display the current date/time and weather in the city of London.  


## IMPLEMENTATION

* To run app clone repo / download and unzip on local machine.

* Ensure Node JS amd npm are installed on local machine and in path.
  (https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)

* Open terminal and navigate to directory where app files are located.

* Run command `npm install`

* This should load all dependencies into directory /node_modules

* Once this has completed run command `npm start`

* Open browser and navigate to `localhost: 8080`

* I hope you will be bale to see my basic 'no-frills' weather app.


## USEFUL INFORMATION

I eleceted to write all CSS manually, rather than use bootstrap or foundation.
I am able to use Saas / Less preprocessors but for this assessment chose not to.

There are many other things I would do to enhance this app, 
however they were outside the scope of a simple 'no-frills protype'.
The only element I stubbed was a basic search box as I think it important that the user can
change the location of the forecast.
